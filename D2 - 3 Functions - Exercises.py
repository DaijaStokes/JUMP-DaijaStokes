#Create a function to calculate the absolute value of a number without using the abs() function to calculate the absolute value for -9 and 7.2


# 2
# for the given data (20,30,40,50,100), create a function to calcuate the total/3 
#note that all the calcualtions have to be done within the function


# 3
#create a function to work in range(43,60) such that if the number is <50, it prints out "LT_50" else it should print out (number+3)


#4
# create a functio which takes 2 inputs as num and x and do the following
#if num>=0 then calcuate num*x else num*x/2


#5 create a function to create a new list with only the nos which can be divided by 3 from the following list
li = [5, 7, 21, 99, 51, 62, 77, 27, 73, 61] 


# 6
#create a function using lambda function to overwrite the following list with all the elements squared
li = [5, 7, 22, 97, 54, 62, 77, 23, 73, 61]
